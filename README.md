# LevelUp Works

*“LevelUp Works”* is a company that provides education technologies to primary and intermediate schools in New Zealand.  It is currently in the process of improving its educational technology platform, and a new application design has been created as a result. The aim of the application is to provide a *Learning Management System (LMS)* for school teachers to deliver the Digital Technologies curriculum (specifically, to deliver classes to learn programming) in an easy way. It is designed so that classes can be conducted either *in person* **or** *online,* although there is no video component included in the application.

The LMS is intended to assist **two** main user groups, both of whom are able to register themselves on the platform:

- **School Students** - Use the platform to get their lesson instructions, request help, and submit their work.

- **School Teachers** - Are able to track student progress and help students where necessary.
